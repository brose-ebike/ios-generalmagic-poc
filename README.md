# General Magic iOS POC

This repository is about our proof of concept evaluating the General Magic iOS SDK. The target is to create a turn by turn navigation based on a predefined route.

## Usage

To run the example, setup the API token on the top of `ContentViewModel.swift`, start the app and simulate the location of the app using the `route.gpx`.

## Documentation

You can find in the `documentation` folder the result of our first evaluation in the `poc.pdf`. In the video `rerouting.mp4` the rerouting behavior of the example is shown.
